# Football-Score-Prediction
This repository contains the Football Score Prediction Project, which aims to predict the outcomes of football matches from premier domestic leagues using machine learning techniques. The datasets used are sourced from Transfermarkt, providing extensive football data, including scores, fixtures, player valuations, and club statistics.
Key Features:

    Data Source: Football data gathered from Transfermarkt, including detailed statistics on clubs and players across various countries.
    Data Cleaning and Preparation: Comprehensive cleaning and merging of multiple datasets to form a master dataset, addressing missing values and ensuring data consistency.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to identify patterns, outliers, and relationships within the data.
    Feature Engineering: Creation of new features such as average home/away goals, cumulative goal differences, and net goal differences to enhance prediction accuracy.
    Machine Learning Models: Implementation of XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithms to predict home and away goals. Extensive cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization for model improvement.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluation of models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure prediction accuracy. Analysis of feature importance to understand the impact of different variables on predictions.
